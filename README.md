Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Tower Datalogger Program
==================================================

Vineyard Pilot Study (2015)
---------------------------

This is an adaption of the [datalogger program][1] running at greenhouse gas 
monitoring towers which are part of the [REACCH project][2]. The program 
combines 10 Hz measurements of CO2 and H2O with 3D wind speeds to generate near
real-time surface fluxes of CO2, latent & sensible heat. Additional 
meteorological statistics are produced at 5 & 30 minute intervals.

The main repository (here) contains the datalogger program only. A second, 
private repository hosts deployment-specific information like network addresses 
and access credentials.
