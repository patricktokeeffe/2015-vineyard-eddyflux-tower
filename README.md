Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Tower Datalogger Program
==================================================

Regional Approaches to Climate Change (2011-2016)
-------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the operating program run by the datalogger at each
greenhouse gas (eddy-covariance) monitoring tower. The program combines 10 Hz
measurements of CO2 and H2O with 3D wind speeds to generate near real-time 
surface fluxes of CO2, latent & sensible heat. Additional meteorological 
statistics are produced at 5 & 30 minute intervals.
