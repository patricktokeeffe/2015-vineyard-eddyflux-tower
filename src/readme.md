*Datalogger Program Source Code*

Sensors are wired to a CR3000 as specified in the OpenDocument Spreadsheet 
`wiring_table.ods`. A PDF copy may be obtained from 
[this page](https://bitbucket.org/wsular/sampler-rea-lt-canister/downloads).

The program `default.cr3` is loaded onto the "brains" of the system, a model
CR3000 datalogger produced by Campbell Scientific Inc.
